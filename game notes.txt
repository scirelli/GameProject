Players get exp so they can use diffrent items.

You can either choose from diffrent char classes to start with or
	biuld a certian type of char as u go along (wizzard, worrior, ranger)

Each char type can only use certian weapons and spells in the game.
	Whether all the items are in the game or just the ones for your char class depends
	on whether you build the char as u go or u pick when you start.
